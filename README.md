Abstract: Camera traps have revolutionized wildlife conservation research by generating vast numbers of images, but their imbalanced species distributions pose a significant challenge to automatic classification. We apply cost-sensitive loss functions and various preprocessing methods to address these issues, significantly improving performance.


According to a recent report from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the average wildlife population has decreased by 73% over the past 50 years. This reduction in biodiversity is driven by various factors, including habitat destruction, pollution, and over-exploitation of species. Biodiversity is not only a measure of ecological health but also a cornerstone of human well-being, influencing critical aspects such as air and water quality, food security, and the dynamics of zoonotic diseases.

Advancements in machine learning (ML) are instrumental in addressing environmental challenges by enabling more effective monitoring and analysis of ecosystems. One area of growing interest is the application of ML to automatically classify camera trap images, which are widely used in ecological studies to estimate species abundance and activity patterns. These sensor-triggered cameras generate vast amounts of images and video that are labor intensive and costly (if not impossible) to label manually.

Our work focuses on addressing the critical challenge of class imbalance in camera trap datasets. We test these methods across two ML architectures: ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2. While CNNs have shown promise in this field, camera trap data presents unique challenges: images often capture only partial views of animals,  exhibit high intra-class variability due to diverse backgrounds, vary in quality and light, and suffer from significant class imbalances that mirror the natural distribution of ecosystems. Such imbalances can bias models toward abundant species, limiting their utility for ecological studies. Achieving balanced performance across species is vital, particularly for studying rare or elusive animals that hold significant ecological importance. As such, solutions are required to address this imbalance.

Thusly, we explore the impact of various loss functions and data augmentation strategies to address class imbalance in camera trap datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to systematically evaluate these techniques across multiple architectures for this application. Our experiments demonstrate that these approaches improve performance on minority classes with minimal impact on majority class performance, leading to a notable increase in macro F1-score.
